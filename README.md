# OpenDataset
Working towards an open world for academia.
We proposed an open Dataset for mobile robots and object detection.

# How To donwload
The dataset can be downloaded under this link [a link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tU1O_PcKCu-GzILI_EAiX7kEPPn7t4cm?usp=sharing)
The dataset is split into simulation and real robot experiments.

From the folder of real Experiments we have UGVs and UAVs folder.
- UAVs are a dataset of Dji
- UGVs contains a dataset of Turtlebot, Rosbots and mixed within multiple environments.


From the folder of Simulations we have UGVs and UAVs folder.
- UAVs are a dataset of Iris drone in Gazebo simulation environment.
- UGVs contains a dataset of Turtlebot, Rosbots, Husky and mixed ground robots within multiple environments.
